# MOOC-Python-2025
Exercices that I completed from the Python 2025 MOOC of Helsinki University. Part 1 to 7 are labelled "*introduction to programming*" whereas Part 8 to 14 are "*advanced course in programming*"

*Note to myself : When I have time, it should be better to put some comment into the exercices, as it could help much better than just giving the answers. Rajouter l'énoncé aussi. En faire une traduction française aussi*
